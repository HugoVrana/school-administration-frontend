# shadcn/ui monorepo template

This is a Vite monorepo template with shadcn/ui.

## Adding components

To add components to your app, run the following command at the root of your `web` app:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button -c apps/web
```

This will place the ui components in the `packages/ui/src/components` directory.

## Using components

To use the components in your app, import them from the `ui` package.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@workspace/ui/components/button";
```

## Clerk user sync

The API app exposes a Clerk webhook endpoint that stores registered users in the application database:

```txt
POST /api/webhooks/clerk
```

Run it with:

```bash
pnpm --filter @school/api dev
```

Configure a Clerk webhook for `user.created` and `user.updated`, then set `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` along with the existing `PG_*` database environment variables for the API app.
